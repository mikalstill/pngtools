<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para> PNGfiles are based around a series of chunks, which embody the information stored in the image file. These chunks have four character ASCII names, where the case of each letter stores additional information.
 </para>
 <para>
 This program decodes the case information in the chunk names, and displays it. The program reads chunk names from stdin, and write chunk descriptions to stdout.
