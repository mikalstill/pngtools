<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para> This command dumps information about the PNG files named on the command line. This command's output is based on the output of the <command>tiffinfo</command> command, which is part of the <command>libtiff</command> distribution. Each line output by the command represents a value that has been set within the PNG file.
 </para>
 <para>
 The <command>-t</command> command line option forces pnginfo to use <emphasis>libtiff</emphasis> <command>tiffinfo</command> style labels, instead of the more relevant png names. The <command>-d</command> command line option dumps the bitmap contained by the image to standard out, whilst the <command>-D</command> command merely checks that the image bitmap could be extracted from the file. If nothing is reported by <command>-D</command>, then there was no error.
 </para>
 <para>
 The format for the output bitmaps is hexadecimal, with each pixel presented as a triple -- for instance [red green blue]. This means that paletted images et cetera will have their bitmaps expanded before display.
